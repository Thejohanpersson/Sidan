                <p>Axis: Bold As Love's scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of the side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chas Chandler, and engineer Ediie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session.</p>
                <p>Hendrix stated that the cover would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his Native American heritage.</p>
